# Win11CapsLockIndicator

This project is simply to resolve a personal need for a visual capslock indicator on my system tray (I have a keyboard with a hard to see caps light). 
This app makes use of .NETs NotifyIcon class and async methods to create a System Tray Icon that changes from White to Green in order to let you know that your CapsLock is on, and has button in the context menu to close the application.

Simply download the application and extract into a folder, and run! To close the app, right click the tray Icon and click Exit.
